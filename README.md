## Planning Story

The API will store information on the user and there workouts. It allows users to register and then add edit and delete workouts. I started this off by creating curl-scripts for the actions of createing updateing and deleteing workouts. Once they were all tested and working I moved on to  creating the routes and Schemas for these actions.

### User Stories

- As a user I want to sign in/up
- As a user I want to Create a new workout
- As a user I want to View all my workouts
- As a user I want to Update past workouts
- As a user I want to Delete a workout

### Technologies Used

- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Express
- Passport

### Unsolved Problems
Still would like to add a section for comments. So users can leave notes on workouts.
